# THE HUMBLE HANDY ROADMAP

* Add configuration engine for internationalization of messages - A json or yml file with mnemonics and message translations

* Translate all API documentaion/comments to english

* To consider some engine to - conditionally - preCompile all regex once at init() and store them in variables. The tradeoff would be the initial loadWeight, specially painful if you do not use those regex functions often

* Add config for rules, to customize passwords and other strings checking/validation

* Assure that all functions are covered by automated tests

* Add those cool badges to repository
